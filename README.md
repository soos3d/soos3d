# Davide | Developer Advocate | Pilot ‚úàÔ∏è üöÅ | Tech Enthusiast üöÄ

Hey there! I'm Davide, a Developer Advocate passionate about empowering others through technology. With a deep understanding of Python, Solidity, JavaScript, and Web3 in general, my mission is to create and share content that inspires and equips developers on their journey, regardless of their level of expertise.

I'm working at Particle Network as Developer Relations accelerating Chain Abstraction.

When I'm not advocating for developer growth, I love tinkering with simple projects in my repositories, where you'll find various resources designed to help beginners sharpen their skills across various programming languages and technologies.

Let's connect and shape the future of technology together!

## Solidity Fundamentals Course
I have a Solidity Basics course on Skillshare! I did my best to focus on the fundamentals explained in a step by step method, use this [link to get 30 days free](https://skl.sh/3rvxBpe) on the platform for every course you like! 

### Who is this course for?

This class is for anyone who wants to start learning smart contract development using the Solidity language! Here we will cover the fundamentals in a step by step method.

Most of the tutorials and courses I followed focus on creating some type of project from the start, which is a great way to learn, but they also go very fast through the basic and I used to find myself not understanding why they write code in a certain way. 

Instead, in this class you will learn the basic concepts of the Solidity coding language and the basic structure of simple smart contracts, as well as learning how to read the solidity documentation.

The goal is for you to complete the class with the ability to understand the basic concepts so that everything will make more sense to you when you dive into more complicated subjects.
